# Doubly-linked list

They told me this was tricky to implement in Rust. They were right.

To this day, I've never had a practical use of a doubly-linked list.
Usually a [deque][] is a better choice. Regardless, this was... "fun" to
implement, and I understand `RefCell`, `Rc`, and `Weak` better now, and
that is the entire point of this repo.
